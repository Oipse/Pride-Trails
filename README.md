# Pride-Trails
29 pride flag trails you can add to your icon set? or icon page? what is even name of that. *sighs*

i made this because i was bored and i had too much free time as casual :)

# Pride flags included
abrosexual, agender, aroace, aromantic, bigender, bisexual, butch lesbian, demiboy, demigender, demigirl, gay, genderfluid, genderflux, genderqueer, gilbertbaker lgbt flag, graysexual, heterosexual, lesbian, lgbt, maverique, nonbinary, omnisexual, pangender, pansexual, philadelphia lgbt flag, polygender, polysexual, transgender, trigender

maybe in future i will add more trails but the size of the image is pretty limited (32x32) and there not many trails that i could do. :)

# How to import the trails to GD
you need to have geode and in it more icons mod installed. then go to your icon page and in there click on the more icons logo in the left. then click on "folder" and go to the "trails" folder. then copy every single file that you downloaded from here (main page -> code -> local > download zip) and paste it into the "trails" folder. then restart your game and it should hopefully work :D
